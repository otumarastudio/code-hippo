# Code Hippo 🦛

Efficient project structuring tool that allows you to collect and organize your code in one place and use it for your LLM.

## Overview

Code Hippo is a command-line tool designed to rapidly process and organize codebases. It provides a comprehensive view of your project structure and file contents, facilitating quick understanding and navigation of complex projects. Think of it as a metal detector for your code jungle, but instead of gold, it finds structure.

## Key Features

- 🗺️ Generates detailed project structure
- 📚 Collects and displays file contents
- 🙈 Respects .gitignore patterns (because some things are better left unseen)
- 🐘 Handles large-scale projects efficiently (it's not just hippos that never forget)

## Installation

```
pip install code-hippo
```

Requires Python 3.7+ (We're not savages, after all)

## Usage

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```
python code-hippo.py
```

Follow the prompts, and watch as Code Hippo chomps through your project.

## Output

Code Hippo generates a markdown file containing:

1. Complete folder structure (a.k.a. your project's family tree)
2. File contents, organized by directory
3. Ignored files and directories (based on .gitignore)

No actual digestion occurs during this process. Your code remains unharmed.

## Use Cases

- Quickly grasping new codebases (without the need for mind-reading abilities)
- Generating project documentation (because your future self will thank you)
- Tracking structural changes over time (spot the "evolutionary" bugs)
- Facilitating code reviews and audits (make your code reviewer's life easier)

## Performance

Designed for efficiency, Code Hippo can process large projects with minimal system resource usage. It's lean, mean, and green (well, more grey, but you get the idea).

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. Please check the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines. Remember, a group of hippos is called a "bloat", but we prefer to keep our codebase unbloated.
